The macros panel is self explanatory, this is where you run a macro, edit or even run the desired macro.

Clicking on "Add Macro" will add a new macro button, you can then rename it and edit the gcode commands for that macro button by "Right Click -> Edit".

You can also move the macro button up or down and also delete the macro entirely.
