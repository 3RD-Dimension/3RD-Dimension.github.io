This panel will be one of the most used, this is where you will enter any manual commands, Zero'ing each or all axis, returning to Zero origin and manual jogging.

* **Enter Manual Code** - At the top there is an input and a send button to send any commands to the controller.
* **Zero Axis Commands**

    * **Zero X** - This sets the current location of X Axis to Zero.
    * **Zero Y** - This sets the current location of Y Axis to Zero.
    * **Zero Z** - This sets the current location of Z Axis to Zero.
    * **Zero All** - This sets the current position of all axis (X, Y, Z) to Zero at once.
    * **Return to Zero** - This returns all axis to where ever you have set zero for the individual axis.  **Note** *Make sure to raise Z axis above the workpiece before clicking this button - as X & Y axis move first then Z axis*.


* **Keyboard Jogging**
    
    * **Enable Keyboard Jogging** - To use your arrow keys or num pad to control the machine, tick this box and click your mouse into the "Jogging Keyboard Focus" - if the box is not focused keyboard jogging will not work - for instance you have moved the mouse to another panel for example.

    * **Jogging Buttons** - There is also a set of jogging buttons (X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z-) that you can use your mouse to control the jogging of the machine.
